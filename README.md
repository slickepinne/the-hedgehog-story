### ðŸ¦” **The story**
I like playing text-based games and in December 2020, I stumbled over [Ink by Inkle](https://github.com/inkle/ink) which was _just a little bit_ mind-blowing. Ink comes with an editor ([Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky)) that lets you start writing your own game right away. No need to have any knowledge about coding, etc. There's even a button, that lets you export your story to web (using [Inkjs](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs)) and you have a fully working game that only waits to get online.

Unfortunately, one day, the editor stopped working and I switched to the command line which is super easy as well. You download `inklecate`, and are able to run your story using `./inklecate -p story.ink` in the terminal or compile it to json with `./inklecate story.ink`. Get `inkjs` with a boilerplate, add your compiled story and check the output in the browser.

Well, and that's it.
